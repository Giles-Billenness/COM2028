# COM2028 Artificial Intelligence - Text Recognition
Coursework created for the COM2028 Artificial Intelligence module during my Computer Science BSc at Surrey University.
Completed Year 2 Summer 2020.

This project explores the automated recognition of printed letters, handwritten letters
and signatures with the help of AI techniques, using publicly available data sets and data
sets of my creation.

Several classification techniques are designed and implemented for each stage of the project,
including: K-nearest Neighbour (KNN), multilayer perceptron neural networks (fully connected neural networks),
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

Experimentation was conducted exclusively with Jupyter notebooks via Google Collab, utilising TensorFlow and scikit-learn.
The code included in this project should work when executing through their default runtime.
